Software engineer specializing in information systems architecture, I started my career at IBM as a developer architect. This experience allowed me to build solid foundations on complex, demanding, and large-scale environments.

Driven by the desire to create and innovate, I then took the path of entrepreneurship by launching my own social network dedicated to content creators. In parallel, I support companies and startups as a freelancer, contributing to high-value-added projects, from design to production.

Passionate about open source, I design and share open solutions, with a strong conviction: software progresses better when it is shared.
